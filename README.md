[00:40.08] I asked her, "Can I have your number?"
[00:42.44] Looks like blue must be your color
[00:44.31] Love the way you wear that dress
[00:46.47] Even though your hair's a mess
[00:48.02] She said it's Isabel Marant
[00:50.12] And I got everything you want
[00:52.34] Only question's, "Can you hang?"
[00:54.56] Will you come and entertain?
[01:08.56] 
[00:56.37] I will, I will, I will
[01:00.49] Never forget the thrill
[01:04.49] We know, we know, we know
[01:08.12] What we came for
[01:10.02] What we came for
[01:18.02] 
[01:12.08] (They don't got it like that)
[01:15.19] (Where you from)
[01:20.20] (They don't got it like that)
[01:23.01] (Where you from)
[01:31.01] 
[01:29.36] If you give me what I want
[01:33.63] I'll give it to you right back
[01:37.46] If you give me what I want
[01:41.72] I'll give it to you right back
[01:56.72] 
[02:00.05] She told me was from Morocco
[02:02.55] By the way of South Chicago
[02:04.38] Graduated in The Bay
[02:06.27] Had her birthday in LA
[02:08.37] Said I had to go to Paris
[02:10.37] Private jet on her parents
[02:12.47] Asked me if I wanna roll
[02:14.42] I said, "If you take me home"
[02:28.92] 
[02:16.31] I will, I will, I will
[02:20.35] Never forget the thrill
[02:24.24] We know, we know, we know
[02:28.28] What we came for
[02:30.05] What we came for
[02:38.05] 
[02:48.19] (They don't got it like that)
[02:51.12] (Where you from)
[02:56.09] (They don't got it like that)
[02:59.04] (Where you from)
[03:07.04] 
[03:05.28] If you give me what I want

[03:45.46] If you give me what I want
[03:49.56] I'll give it to you right back

I asked her
"Can I have your number?
Looks like blue
must be your color
Love the way you wear that dress
Even though your hair's a mess"
She said "It's Isabel Marant
And I got everything you want
Only question's can you hang?
Will you come and entertain?"
I will, I will, I will
Never forget the thrill
We know, we know, we know
What we came for
What we came for
(They don't got it like that,
where you from?)
(They don't got it like that,
where you from?)
If you give me what I want
I'll give it to you right back
If you give me what I want
I'll give it to you right back
She told me she was from Morocco
By the way of south Chicago
Graduated in the Bay
Had her birthday in LA
Said I had to go to Paris
Private jets on her parents
Asked me if I wanna roll
I said: "If you take me home"
I will, I will, I will
Never forget the thrill
We know, we know, we know
What we came for
What we came for
(They don't got it like that,
where you from?)
(They don't got it like that,
where you from?)
If you give me what I want
I'll give it to you right back
If you give me what I want
I'll give it to you right back
If you give me what I want
I'll give it to you right back
If you give me what I want
I'll give it to you right back
